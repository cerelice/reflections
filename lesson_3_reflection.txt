When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you work from diffrent computers, places or other people also work with
your project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because changes on remote may be done not by me and I may don't want to pull all
of them, as they may be wrong or smth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Fork is clone from GitHub repository to another GitHub repository, Clone is made
between 2 repositories anywhere - from GitHub repository to local or from local
to local. Branch is new substance in the same repositority, it is not linear
changes.

Fork is beter to use when you want to make some changes to someone project, but
have them separated from original version. Clone is used when you want to have a
copy of some remote in your computer and work with it. Branch is used for
applying not linear changes in existing repo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Then there will happen fast-forward merge when you pull, it is more convinient
and faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?

Via Dropbox or some service like it. Or may be just by sending files to each
other. It would be harder to compare and merge files, to have one version of
project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you work with other people and changes may create conflicts.
